# pyRegexFileRenamer
Python 3 TKInter app for doing mass file renaming using regexes.

This is basically a thin GUI wrapper over Python's regular expression sub() method and os.path functionality.  You can use it to do mass substitutions on file names in a given folder and its subfolders.

This is a self-project by me for learning the Tkinker library and also for porting over a similar functionality from a VERY OLD .NET app that I wrote a long time ago.

It's not super user friendly, but if you understand Python and understand regular expressions (especially Python's re module), it should be pretty self explanatory.
